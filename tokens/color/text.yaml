          ### Accessibility

          Contrast is important when choosing colors for UI elements for visitors.
          Awareness of standards and best practices is the key to an accessible color palette.
          We are committed to complying with the
          [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance.html)
          standard contrast ratios. We choose colors that support usability by ensuring sufficient
          color contrast between elements so that visitors with low vision can browse our web
          properties.

          #### Text on backgrounds

          Black text should be used on light backgrounds and vice versa. If a page features both
          light and dark themes, UI elements and text should be placed on contrasting background
          colors. Layouts with colored backgrounds or a photo changes the rules regarding the
          placement of text, so use white or black text for body copy applications.
